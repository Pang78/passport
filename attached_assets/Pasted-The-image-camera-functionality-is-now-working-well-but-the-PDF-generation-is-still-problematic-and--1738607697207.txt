The image/camera functionality is now working well, but the PDF generation is still problematic and producing subpar results. Additionally, ensure that the entire codebase is thoroughly reviewed and free of issues before deployment.

Requirements:

PDF Functionality:
The PDF generation is currently "very lousy" and needs significant improvement.
Ensure that the PDF is generated with proper formatting, fonts, and layout.
Verify that all required fonts (e.g., LiberationSans-Bold.ttf, LiberationSans-Regular.ttf) are correctly loaded and used.
Handle any errors or warnings related to PDF generation (e.g., font loading, file paths, or library issues).
Optimize the PDF output for readability and professional appearance.
Code Review and Debugging:
Conduct a thorough review of the entire codebase to identify and fix any potential issues.
Ensure that the code is clean, efficient, and free of bugs or logical errors.
Pay special attention to error handling, edge cases, and dependencies.
Pre-Deployment Checks:
Verify that all functionalities (PDF, image/camera, and any others) are working as expected.
Ensure that the code is production-ready and adheres to best practices.
Perform testing to confirm that there are no runtime errors, memory leaks, or performance bottlenecks.
Do Not Change the AI Model:
The AI model is functioning correctly and should not be modified.
Focus only on improving the PDF functionality and ensuring the code is deployment-ready.
Deliverables:

Improved and fully functional PDF generation code.
A clean, bug-free, and optimized codebase ready for deployment.
A summary of the changes made and issues resolved.
Instructions for testing the updated functionalities.
Example Input Code (if available):

javascript
Copy
// Example PDF function (currently "very lousy")
const generatePdf = async (data) => {
  try {
    const pdfDoc = await PDFDocument.create();
    const fontPath = 'client/public/standard_fonts/LiberationSans-Bold.ttf';
    const fontBytes = fs.readFileSync(fontPath);
    const font = await pdfDoc.embedFont(fontBytes);
    const page = pdfDoc.addPage();
    page.drawText('Hello World', { x: 50, y: 50, size: 30, font });
    const pdfBytes = await pdfDoc.save();
    fs.writeFileSync('output.pdf', pdfBytes);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error generating PDF:', error);
  }
};
Expected Output:

The PDF generation should produce high-quality, well-formatted PDFs.
The entire codebase should be free of issues and ready for deployment.
No changes should be made to the AI model.
Additional Notes:

If specific issues with the PDF generation are known (e.g., font loading errors, layout problems, etc.), please provide details.
Include any relevant error messages or logs to help pinpoint the issues.
If there are specific requirements for the PDF (e.g., headers, footers, tables, etc.), please specify them.
