Revamp the passport image capture workflow to prioritize officer control, accuracy, and ease of use. Replace the current autocapture system with a streamlined manual capture process while improving the camera interface for efficiency and reliability.

Key Requirements:

Remove Autocapture Feature
Completely disable the existing autocapture functionality.
Ensure no automated triggers (e.g., edge detection, auto-snapping) interfere with manual operation.
Manual Capture Redesign
Introduce a dedicated, prominent manual capture button (e.g., large circular UI element with haptic feedback).
Allow officers to:
Tap to focus freely.
Adjust framing/alignment before capturing.
Review/retake images instantly post-capture.
Enhanced Camera Flow
Alignment Guides:
Add real-time overlay guides (e.g., passport outline, corner markers, text alignment grid).
Include dynamic feedback (color changes/sound) when the passport is properly aligned.
Lighting Optimization:
Auto-detect glare/shadows and provide on-screen prompts (e.g., "Adjust angle to reduce glare").
Edge Cases Handling:
Simplify capture for non-standard passports (e.g., damaged spines, folded pages).
Performance Improvements
Reduce latency between capture and image processing.
Ensure compatibility with low-light environments (e.g., airport checkpoints).
User-Centric Additions:

Training Mode: Include a demo/tutorial for new officers to practice alignment and capture.
Error Prevention:
Auto-flag blurry/glared images before submission.
Add a "Best Practices" checklist (e.g., "Ensure MRZ code is visible").
Example Workflow:

Officer opens camera → sees alignment guides/overlay.
Adjusts passport position → receives real-time feedback (e.g., green outline when aligned).
Manually taps capture button → previews image.
Chooses "Retake" or "Confirm" → proceeds to next step.
Why This Works:

Control: Prioritizes officer judgment over automation.
Clarity: Visual/haptic feedback reduces training time.
Efficiency: Streamlined flow minimizes repetitive actions.
