 PDF Processing Issues

Potential Problems:

PDF.js Configuration: The code uses pdfjs-dist for PDF processing, but there might be issues with font loading or worker initialization.
If the standard_fonts path is incorrect or missing, text extraction might fail.
The worker script (pdf.worker.mjs) might not load properly, causing the PDF processing to hang or crash.
Text Extraction: The code attempts to extract text from PDF pages, but:
Scanned PDFs (image-based) will not have machine-readable text, so getTextContent will return empty results.
The logic for grouping text items by vertical position (lineGroups) might not work well for all PDF layouts, especially if the passport data is not in a consistent format.
Large PDFs: If the PDF is large (e.g., many pages or high-resolution images), the processing might time out or consume too much memory.
Solutions:

Handle Scanned PDFs: Add OCR (e.g., pytesseract) for image-based PDFs. Use pdf2image to convert PDF pages to images and then extract text using OCR.
Validate Font Paths: Ensure the standard_fonts directory exists and is correctly referenced.
Optimize PDF.js: Use a smaller scale (e.g., 1.0) for faster processing, and limit the number of pages processed at once.
Error Handling: Add better error handling for cases where text extraction fails or returns empty results.
2. OpenAI API Integration Issues

Potential Problems:

Rate Limits: The OpenAI API has rate limits, and if the PDF contains many pages or sections, the API calls might exceed the limit.
Invalid JSON Responses: The code assumes the OpenAI API will always return valid JSON. If the response is malformed, JSON.parse will throw an error.
Token Limits: GPT-4 has a token limit (e.g., 8,192 tokens). If the extracted text is too long, the API call will fail.
Solutions:

Rate Limiting: Implement a delay between API calls (e.g., setTimeout) to avoid hitting rate limits.
Validate API Responses: Wrap JSON.parse in a try-catch block to handle malformed responses gracefully.
Chunk Text: Split the extracted text into smaller chunks that fit within the token limit before sending it to the API.
3. File Upload and Buffer Handling

Potential Problems:

Large Files: The multer configuration limits file size to 10MB, but large PDFs might still cause memory issues during processing.
Buffer Handling: The code passes the entire PDF buffer to processPdfPassport, which might not be efficient for large files.
Solutions:

Stream Processing: Use streams to process the PDF in chunks instead of loading the entire file into memory.
File Size Validation: Reject files larger than a certain threshold (e.g., 10MB) with a clear error message.
4. CSV Export Issues

Potential Problems:

File Path: The CSV file is saved to ./exports/passport_data.csv, but the exports directory might not exist, causing an error.
Concurrent Writes: If multiple users upload PDFs simultaneously, the CSV file might be overwritten or corrupted.
Solutions:

Create Directory: Ensure the exports directory exists before writing the CSV file.
Unique Filenames: Use a unique filename (e.g., based on a timestamp or UUID) for each CSV file to avoid conflicts.
5. General Error Handling

Potential Problems:

The code has some error handling, but it might not cover all edge cases (e.g., network issues, API timeouts, or invalid PDFs).
Errors are logged to the console but might not provide enough context for debugging.
Solutions:

Comprehensive Error Handling: Add try-catch blocks around all asynchronous operations and log detailed error messages.
User-Friendly Messages: Return clear, user-friendly error messages in the API response (e.g., "The PDF could not be processed due to an internal error").
6. Security Concerns

Potential Problems:

Sensitive Data: The code processes passport data, which is highly sensitive. Storing or logging this data improperly could lead to privacy violations.
File Uploads: Allowing arbitrary file uploads could expose the server to malicious files (e.g., viruses or scripts).
Solutions:

Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data before storing or transmitting it.
File Validation: Validate uploaded files to ensure they are legitimate PDFs (e.g., using a library like file-type).
