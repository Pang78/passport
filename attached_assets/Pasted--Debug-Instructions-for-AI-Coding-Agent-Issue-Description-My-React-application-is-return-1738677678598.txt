### Debug Instructions for AI Coding Agent:

**Issue Description:**  
My React application is returning a **502 Bad Gateway** error on the deployed version in Replit. The development environment (`.dev`) works perfectly, but the deployed site shows a blank white screen. The following errors appear in the browser console:  

```
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 () (main.tsx, line 0)  
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 () (client, line 0)  
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 () (@react-refresh, line 0)  
[Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 502 () (icalogo.jpg, line 0)
```

### Possible Causes and Debug Steps:

1. **Build Missing or Not Generated**  
   - Ensure the app is built for production by running:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```
   - Verify that the `build/` folder is served in the backend using Express or a similar server:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const path = require('path');
     const app = express();

     app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

     app.get('*', (req, res) => {
       res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
     });

     const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
     ```

2. **Static Files Not Loaded**  
   - The error for `icalogo.jpg` suggests that static assets may not be served or referenced correctly.
   - Verify that the image is in the `/public` folder and referenced properly:
     ```jsx
     <img src="/icalogo.jpg" alt="ICA Logo" />
     ```

3. **Port Configuration Issue**  
   - Replit requires apps to listen on `process.env.PORT`. If the port is hardcoded (e.g., `3000`), it will cause a 502 error.  
   - Update the server to use `process.env.PORT`:
     ```javascript
     const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
     ```

4. **Development Code in Production**  
   - The `@react-refresh` error indicates that the development server code (`npm run dev`) might be included in production.  
   - Ensure the app is built and deployed in **production mode**:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

5. **API or Backend Connectivity**  
   - If the frontend relies on a backend, check if the backend is running and accessible from the deployed site.
   - Test API endpoints using Postman or `curl`.

### Additional Information Needed for Debugging:

1. **`package.json` scripts** â€“ Check `dev`, `build`, and `start` commands.  
2. **Server Code** â€“ How are you serving the frontend? Is there an Express server or just a static deployment?  
3. **Folder Structure** â€“ How are your static assets organized (`public`, `src`, etc.)?  
4. **Deployment Process** â€“ Are you using Replitâ€™s native build/deploy tools or custom commands?

---

**Goal for the AI Agent:**  
1. Analyze the server configuration and deployment scripts for potential issues.  
2. Ensure that the frontend build is generated and served correctly.  
3. Verify that static files and API endpoints are accessible in the deployed environment.  
4. Suggest improvements to make the deployment more stable and reliable.
